# Popularityheatspot

Popularity head spot - vue.js based project, playing around with using a json object and vue to show the popularity of certain seats within given, theatre for instance.

Page designed by myself including logo created in html as I wanted to animate it but haven't gotten around to doing so, I haven't really focused on the responsive aspect, it was just a personal project I was playing around with.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
run npm dev
```
